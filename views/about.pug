        .about-bio

          p I've had a lifelong passion for programming starting at age eight when I found GameMaker, giving me endless fun exploring and expanding my programming knowledge and game design. Even though it started very basic it paved the way for my passion for both programming and gaming. <br/><br/>Since then i have seriously persued both paths, competing professionally in E-sport for a few years and also studying programming at both highschool and University level. But I still have a deep desire to learn more and further cultivate my programming knowledge.
